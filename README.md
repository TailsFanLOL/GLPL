# This is the repository for the Good Luck Public License (GLPL)

It is inspired by the satire, probably not legally enforcable, GLWTPL (Good Luck With That Public License).  
Since it's difficult to track versions with no authorship, a UUID requirement has been added.  
It is in LICENSE.md

I may also have missed some edge cases, please open issues.
