# This is the repository for the Good Luck Public License (GLPL)

It is inspired by the satire, probably not legally enforcable, GLWTPL (Good Luck With That Public License).  
Since it's difficult to track versions with no authorship, a UUID requirement has been added.  
It is in LICENSE.md. Might move this off of GitHub. Later.

TL;DR: remove/change credit unless mainlining ("I did NOT do that shit"), specific instance of license can be indexed by search engines.

TW: empl*yment synonymous wording.

### I AM NOT A LAWYER

I may also have missed some edge cases, please open issues. This will obviously only change this specific central instance of this license.

It might (?) be up to FSF standards but definitely not OSI compliant.

This very file (if it even counts as original enough) is hereby also licensed under the license in LICENSE.md.
